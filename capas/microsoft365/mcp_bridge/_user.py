"""Which mailbox/calendar/chat-list a tool call acts on.

This connection authenticates app-only (`client_credentials`, see
`oauth/provisioning.py`), so the token carries no user at all. Microsoft Graph
answers every `/me/...` path with

    400 BadRequest -- /me request is only valid with delegated authentication flow.

because `/me` resolves through the token's user claim and an app-only token has
none. There is no signed-in anyone here: every mailbox-scoped call must name
its target explicitly as `/users/{id}/...`.

Two ways to name it, in this order:

1. the tool call's own optional `userId` argument -- a UPN
   (`sina@contoso.com`) or a Graph object id -- which is what lets one agent
   work across several mailboxes the app registration is scoped to; or
2. the connection's configured default mailbox, carried into the bridge
   process as `MICROSOFT365_DEFAULT_USER` from the setup form's `default_user`
   field, so the common single-mailbox case does not force the model to guess
   a UPN on every single call.

Neither present is a configuration error, not a call to make against Graph:
raising here says so in words an operator can act on, rather than building
`/users//messages` and letting Graph answer something unrelated.
