"""Teams and Contacts tools -- Teams is READ-ONLY here, deliberately.

Microsoft Graph has no application permission for *sending* a Teams message.
`POST /teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages` and `POST /chats/{id}/messages` are
covered only by the delegated-only `ChannelMessage.Send` / `Chat.ReadWrite`
scopes; the sole app-only permission in that area, `Teamwork.Migrate.All`, is
for one-time migration/import of historical messages, not for an agent talking
to people. This plugin authenticates org-wide with `client_credentials` (design
doc §4.1a: there is no signed-in anyone), so a send tool here could only ever
403 -- every call, in every tenant, no matter what an admin consents to.

So the two send tools this pack originally listed were removed rather than
shipped as dead surface -- the same "state the Graph asymmetry, don't oversell
it" discipline as `powerpoint.py`'s missing slide-level edit. Reading
stays: `teams_list_channels`, `teams_list_chats` and the Contacts tools all
have real application permissions.
