"""The bridge's own tiny Graph client (`mcp_bridge/graph.py`).

It builds its `httpx.AsyncClient` itself -- no transport seam like
`oc8.oauth.http`, deliberately, since it runs in a separate process with no
oc8 imports at all. So these tests swap the class it constructs for a factory
that keeps every kwarg (`follow_redirects` above all) and only substitutes the
transport. That is what makes "does this call follow the redirect" testable
rather than assumed.
