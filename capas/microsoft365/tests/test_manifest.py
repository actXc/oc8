than parsing `plugin.toml` alone: after the split, `plugin.toml` on its own is
only the slim core, and it is discovery's assembly of the sibling files that
has to be right. A test that read just `plugin.toml` would now pass while the
tool pack, the presets and the whole setup form were silently missing.
