"""Proves the retrofitted `provider/` package is importable at its new path and
still registers -- through the REAL loader, so the `plugin.toml` entry-point
string is proved too.

This plugin had no test of any kind before the restructure (verified: `find
backend/tests -iname "*opaas*"` was empty), which meant the one thing this
retrofit changes -- `providers = "provider.provider:register"` -- had nothing
watching it. One test, going through `find_plugin`/`load_plugin` rather than
importing `provider.provider` directly, is what makes a typo in that string a
red test instead of a silent no-op at runtime (Task 11's review, Important #3).
