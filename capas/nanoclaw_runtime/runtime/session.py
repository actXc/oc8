"""Session layout for a nanoclaw-hosted run.

oc8 takes nanoclaw's HOST role, so it owns the folder layout described in
nanoclaw's docs/db-session.md: a group folder (CLAUDE.md, container.json,
working files) and a session folder (the two SQLite DBs and the heartbeat).

The group folder is mounted read-write into the container, so anything under it
is reachable from inside. It is deliberately per-RUN, not per-agent, and lives
BESIDE the session rather than nested inside it (see `group_dir` / `session_dir`)
for two separate reasons:

- nesting the session inside the group folder would let one run reach another
  run's session -- read its inbound/outbound DBs, inject a message, or forge
  its ack;
- a per-AGENT group folder would let nanoclaw's agent-runner use it for more
  than CLAUDE.md and container.json: it also scaffolds a memory tree there at
  boot (`/workspace/agent/memory/{index.md,system/definition.md}`, nanoclaw's
  `ensureMemoryScaffold()`) and reloads those files into the model's context on
  every later run. A per-agent folder would make that memory tree survive
  across runs -- a second, un-gated persistence channel a container could use
  to implant standing instructions for its agent's FUTURE runs, bypassing
  oc8's own approval-gated memory writes (`resolve_memory_write_approval`)
  entirely. Making the group folder per-run closes that: it dies with the
  session, same as everything else the container can write.

The cost is visible, not hidden: nanoclaw's own cross-run agent memory feature
no longer persists anything in oc8, because the folder it would persist into no
longer survives past one run. oc8 does not use that feature -- agents get
cross-run memory through oc8's own gated subsystem instead -- so this trades a
feature we do not use for a hole we do not want.

`platform_mounts` additionally nests the agent's own `container.json` and
`CLAUDE.md` back in read-only on top of the (now per-run) group folder,
mirroring upstream, so the container can read its own configuration without
being able to rewrite it mid-run.

The DBs themselves are created by nanoclaw's own code -- see provision_session.
Writing their schema here would fork it, and a pin bump would then break us
silently.

#: Every tool the pinned harness OFFERS an oc8 agent. MEASURED, not read off a

#: the list below got it wrong. Reproduce by running the CLI out of
#: `nanoclaw-agent:latest` against a stub Anthropic endpoint with the flags the
#: runner passes (`query()` in the agent-runner's `providers/claude.ts`) and
#: reading the `tools` array of the `system`/`init` line it prints:
#:
#:     claude -p hi --output-format stream-json --verbose \
#:       --permission-mode bypassPermissions --dangerously-skip-permissions \

#:       --allowedTools <TOOL_ALLOWLIST + mcp__*__*> \
#:       --disallowedTools <SDK_DISALLOWED_TOOLS>
#:
#: Measured 2026-08-02 against CLI 2.1.197 / `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
#: 0.3.197 (two different numbers for the same pin: `claude --version` reports
#: the first, `/app/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/package.json`
#: the second -- an earlier version of this comment quoted the CLI number under
#: the package name `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, which is neither).
#:
#: The runner's own `TOOL_ALLOWLIST` is NOT this list and must never be read as
#: one: `allowedTools` becomes permission ALLOW rules, it does not narrow the
#: surface (narrowing is `--tools`, which the runner never passes). Measured
#: both ways -- `Workflow`, `Monitor`, `PushNotification` and the four `Task*`
#: list tools are offered while appearing nowhere in `TOOL_ALLOWLIST`, and
#: `TeamCreate`/`TeamDelete`/`TodoWrite`/`ToolSearch` sit IN `TOOL_ALLOWLIST`
#: and do not exist in this CLI at all. Naming a tool that does not exist in a
#: deny rule is not free: the CLI answers on stderr, once per leg, with
#: `Permission deny rule "TeamCreate" matches no known tool -- check for typos.`
#: An entry that draws that line is an entry protecting nothing.
#:
#: `WaitForMcpServers` is in this list but is offered CONDITIONALLY: it appears
#: only while some MCP server is still `pending`, which is exactly when
#: `runtime._READINESS_BLOCK` tells the agent to call it (verified by giving the
#: probe a deliberately slow second server). `Agent` is not offered under that
#: name -- `Task` is -- but the CLI knows it as `Task`'s alias and does not warn
#: on it, so denying both costs nothing and survives an alias flip.

#: Harness tools an oc8 agent must not have. Not a tidiness measure -- each one
#: is either a governance hole or a dead end the model cannot tell apart from
#: the real thing:
#:
#: * `Agent`/`Task` spawn a sub-agent INSIDE the container. It inherits no
#:   frame, spends no budget anybody counts, and appears in no audit trail --
#:   precisely the ungoverned worker oc8's whole permission model exists to
#:   prevent. oc8 has its own answer for handing work on (`delegate_task`),
#:   which creates a real run for a real agent under its own frame.
#: * `Workflow` is that same hole with a fan-out multiplier, and it was missed
#:   the first time because it is not in the runner's `TOOL_ALLOWLIST`. Its own
#:   description: "Execute a workflow script that orchestrates multiple
#:   subagents deterministically… Workflows can spawn dozens of agents and
#:   consume a large amount of tokens; the user must request that scale". Those
#:   agents run in this container under no oc8 frame, and their model calls go
#:   out over `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` -- oc8's own LLM gateway, on this run's
#:   token. The only thing standing between an agent and that is a sentence in
#:   the tool description asking for opt-in, which is precisely the kind of
#:   guard the closing paragraph here says is not enough. It also "returns
#:   immediately with a task ID" and promises a later `<task-notification>`:
#:   nanoclaw awaits one `provider.query()` per message batch (`poll-loop.ts`)
#:   and oc8 tears the container down when the run ends, so that notification
#:   has nowhere to land even when the work succeeds.
#: * `SendMessage` addresses sibling agents in the container, not an operator,
#:   and answers otherwise with "No agent named 'operator' is currently
#:   addressable. Spawn a new one or use the agent ID." -- which reads like a
#:   setup problem, so a model retries it. Observed live 2026-07-29: ten of a
#:   lead's twenty-two steps went there before it gave up.
#: * `Skill` is the harness's own skill loader and cannot reach oc8's skills,
#:   which arrive over the bridge. A model that calls it is told the skill does
#:   not exist, and the procedure it was supposed to follow never loads.
#: * `PushNotification` "sends a desktop notification in the user's terminal.
#:   If Remote Control is connected, it also pushes to their phone." There is no
#:   terminal and no Remote Control behind a headless agent container, and the
#:   tool tells the model so in advance: "If the result says the push wasn't
#:   sent, that's expected -- no action needed." Its description also recommends
#:   itself for "you've hit something that needs their decision before you can
#:   continue", which is the exact situation this whole list exists for -- so it
#:   is a second, quieter answer to the question `request_decision` answers, and
#:   the model cannot tell that nobody was reached.
#: * `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` are the agent's only routes to the open internet,
#:   and this deployment deliberately has none: agent containers sit on the
#:   `agents` docker network, declared `internal: true` (docker-compose.yml, and
#:   `docker network inspect oc8_agents` reports `Internal: true`), whose whole
#:   point is that a container "can reach the control plane and NOTHING else --
#:   not the database, not the internet". `WebFetch` therefore cannot connect at
#:   all, and `WebSearch` is executed server-side by whatever endpoint the LLM
#:   gateway fronts, which nobody here has configured to serve it. If oc8 ever
#:   wants the web it belongs behind an oc8 tool with the SSRF-guarded fetcher
#:   the knowledge connectors already use, not behind a harness built-in that
#:   nothing audits.
#:
#: The names above are the harness's BUILT-IN tools. Its MCP server ("nanoclaw",
#: registered by the runner itself, `src/mcp-tools/index.ts`) offers nine more
#: as `mcp__nanoclaw__…`, and the first list did not cover a single one of them.
#: Measured 2026-08-02: Sina was asked for the oldest open helpdesk ticket, got
#: her oc8 skill, and then called `mcp__nanoclaw__ask_user_question`. The run
#: failed after 32s with "the agent container stopped responding" (session
#: 019fa4f7-…/019fc314-…). That tool BLOCKS in-container for up to 300s polling
#: `inbound.db` for a question response, and oc8 never writes one -- so the
#: container simply stops answering until the executor gives up.
#:
#: The rest of that server is judged one by one, because two of the nine work:
#: * `send_message` DOES reach the operator here -- `write_routing` creates the
#:   `operator` destination, and `messages.to_agent_message` turns the resulting
#:   `chat` row into a real agent message. Offered.
#: * `send_card` likewise: `messages._text_of` has a branch for exactly its
#:   `fallbackText`/`card.description`/`card.title` shape. Offered.
#: * `create_agent`, `install_packages`, `add_mcp_server` all write a `system`
#:   row and answer "you will be notified when admin approves". `system` is in
#:   `messages._SILENT_KINDS`; nothing on the oc8 side reads those rows, so no
#:   notification is ever coming. `create_agent` is `Agent` again besides.
#: * `edit_message`, `add_reaction` write `chat` rows whose `operation` is in
#:   `messages._SILENT_OPERATIONS` -- dropped. A model that "corrects" a wrong
#:   answer with `edit_message` is told the edit was queued, and the wrong
#:   answer is what the operator keeps.
#: * `send_file` copies the file into `/workspace/outbox`, which oc8 never
#:   reads, and delivers only the accompanying text. The one part the model
#:   called it for is the part that silently disappears.
#:
#: SYNTAX, checked rather than assumed -- a deny entry that matches nothing is
#: this defect shipped again behind a comment claiming it is fixed. In the
#: pinned CLI an MCP tool is matched by its FULL `mcp__<server>__<tool>` name:
#: the rule matcher compares `rule.toolName` against `mcpInfo ?
#: mcp__server__tool : name`. Two further facts make this work at all, and both
#: were verified in that binary rather than taken on trust: the deny rules are
#: consulted BEFORE the permission mode, so they still bite under the
#: `bypassPermissions` the runner starts every session with; and the tool list
#: itself is filtered by them (`tools.filter(t => !denyRule(ctx, t))`), so a
#: denied tool is not offered rather than refused on use -- which is the whole
#: point. Then measured end to end: with this list in `settings.json` the probe
#: above offers 17 tools -- `Bash Edit Glob Grep Monitor NotebookEdit Read
#: TaskCreate TaskGet TaskList TaskOutput TaskStop TaskUpdate WaitForMcpServers
#: Write mcp__nanoclaw__send_card mcp__nanoclaw__send_message` -- against 31
#: without it. `ask_user_question` is gone, and so is every other name below.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT denied, having been checked:
#: * `WaitForMcpServers` -- a harness BUILT-IN, not an `mcp__nanoclaw__…` tool
#:   (it is nowhere in that server's registry). `runtime._READINESS_BLOCK` tells
#:   every agent to call it and two live runs did. A blanket `mcp__nanoclaw__*`
#:   would have been safe for it by luck; this list does not depend on luck.
#: * `TaskOutput`/`TaskStop` -- they LOOK like companions to the denied `Task`,
#:   but the CLI's alias map (`{Task: "Agent", BashOutput: "TaskOutput",
#:   KillShell: "TaskStop", …}`) shows they are the canonical names for reading
#:   and killing a background `Bash`. Denying them would take that away.
#: * `TaskCreate`/`TaskGet`/`TaskList`/`TaskUpdate` -- the CLI's own to-do list,
#:   `TodoWrite`'s replacement. In-session bookkeeping with no effect outside
#:   the container and nothing to mistake for reaching a human.
#: * `Monitor` -- `Bash(run_in_background)` with its stdout turned into
#:   notifications. It returns immediately, so it cannot wedge a run the way
#:   `ask_user_question` does, and it cannot outlive the container. No measured
#:   harm, so it stays: this list denies what was shown to break, not what looks
#:   unfamiliar.
#:
#: Naming them in the instructions worked (`SendMessage` attempts went from ten
#: to zero) but only for as long as the model reads carefully under pressure.
#: A tool that is not offered cannot be reached for at all.

    `provision_session` for the same reason.

    This file lands at `<claude-home>/settings.json`, mounted as

    in its `providers/claude.ts`) -- which is why writing here is enough.

    KNOWN GAP, measured 2026-08-02 and deliberately not fixed here. Sharing a
    file with the provisioner means sharing its fate: if the CLI rejects the

    runs.

    `settings.json` is nested the same way and for a sharper reason: it is the
    file that carries `DENIED_HARNESS_TOOLS`, and `/home/node/.claude` around it
    has to stay writable (the SDK keeps its resume transcript there, see
    `claude_home_dir`). The runner calls `provider.query()` once per message
    batch (`poll-loop.ts`) and each call spawns a fresh `claude` that re-reads
    the user settings -- so without this mount an agent holding `Write` or
    `Bash` could empty the deny list and be offered every tool again on the very
    next wake, inside the same container. Measured 2026-08-02: with the
    directory mount alone, `echo x >> /home/node/.claude/settings.json` inside
    the pinned agent image succeeds; with this mount it fails with `Read-only
    file system`, and the CLI still starts and still honours the deny list (the
    same probe recipe as `HARNESS_TOOL_SURFACE`, run both ways).

    `group` is the caller's own `group_dir(root, agent.id, run_id)` and
    `claude_home` its `claude_home_dir(root, agent.id, run_id)` -- both the SAME
    paths `session_mounts_for` already put through the session allowlist for its
    own (read-write) mounts, so nesting these read-only files on top of them
    needs no second validation pass. The three files themselves must already
    exist by the time this mount list is used: docker creates a missing
    bind-mount SOURCE as a directory, which would shadow the real file. The
    caller writes all three (`write_container_json`, `write_claude_md`,
    `write_claude_settings`) before building the sandbox spec that carries these
