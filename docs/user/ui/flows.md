# Flows

**Route:** `/flows`

## What it is

A **flow** is a multi-stage process across departments — a recipe: stage 1 in
Support, stage 2 in Finance, stage 3 back to Support, and so on.

Stages are usually linked by [Handoffs](handoffs.md). Live validation shows
whether the next stage can start.

## What it is for

- Encode end-to-end business processes (not just one agent task)
- See which stage a pipeline run is in
- Reuse the same process for many cases

## Where you are in the flow

```text
Design Flow (once) → start a Flow run → stages execute / pause
  → Handoffs + My work for gates → Flow completes
```

You are here when designing or monitoring a **pipeline**, not when answering a
single approval (that is [My work](my-work.md)).

## What you do here

1. Open **Flows**; create a flow or open an existing one.
2. Build stages on the canvas (which department / what handoff).
3. Start a run when ready.
4. Watch stage status; open blocked stages via Handoffs or My work.

## Where work goes next

| Situation | Next |
|-----------|------|
| Stage waiting on transfer | [Handoffs](handoffs.md) |
| Stage waiting on person | [My work](my-work.md) |
| Stage is agent work | [Agents](agents.md) / department board |
| Need tools for a stage | [Capas](capas.md) + department permissions |
