#: Tenant-scoped tables that are NOT part of a company's portable backup.
#: See design doc §2.1 for why each is excluded. A denylist, not an
#: allowlist: a new `TenantMixin` table is included automatically, and
#: `test_excluded_tables_all_exist` breaks the build if a name here is ever
#: renamed rather than letting it silently re-enter the export.
#:
#: `token_usage_record` is here for a reason the design doc originally missed:
#: migration 0001 lists it beside `audit_event` in `_IMMUTABLE_TABLES` and does
#: `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ... FROM oc8_app` on both. So a restore *cannot*
#: replace this table -- the grant forbids it -- and the only two options are
#: to leave it alone or to merge the archive's rows into whatever is already
#: there. A merge would make a restored company's metering history the UNION of
#: two billing ledgers, which is worse than either: a same-tenant rollback
#: would keep usage recorded after the backup, and a cross-instance restore
#: would permanently graft another company's usage onto this one, with no
#: DELETE grant left to undo it. Metering history belongs to the instance that
#: recorded it, exactly as the audit log does.
#:
#: `push_subscription` is excluded for the same reason as `secret`/`tenant_dek`:
#: its rows are device-scoped credentials bound to THIS instance's one VAPID key
#: pair. Restored into another instance they would never authenticate against
#: that instance's key, so every send would fail silently and the rows would
#: never re-validate -- meaningless data that only looks like a live subscription.
#:
#: `account_verification_token` is excluded for the same class of reason as
#: `secret`/`tenant_dek`/`push_subscription`: its rows are single-use,
#: time-limited security tokens (password-reset / email-change confirmation,
#: account self-service design §4.4), not portable company data. Restoring one
#: into another instance -- or back into this one after the window it was
#: mailed for has passed -- would only resurrect a credential that should stay
#: dead, never anything a restored company needs.
