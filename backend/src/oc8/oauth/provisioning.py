"""Provider-keyed OAuth connection provisioning (tech-spec §11.2).

Two call sites need to turn "an admin typed an app registration's credentials"
into a working OAuthConnection: the `/oauth/{provider}/service-connection`
endpoint, and the generic plugin setup form (`api/v1/capas.py`, for a
manifest carrying `[plugin.setup.oauth_provision]`). Keeping the minting itself
here -- rather than inline in either caller -- is what lets both share one
source of truth, and it mirrors the existing static registry in
`oc8.oauth.providers` instead of teaching core a second way to know about a
provider.

Transaction discipline follows `oc8.oauth.tokens`: add/flush only, never commit
and never roll back. The caller owns the transaction, so a caller that has
already written other rows (the setup form stores plugin secrets first) decides
what a failure here means for them.

#: assertion requesting any scope string outside what was authorized in the
#: Admin Console is rejected with `unauthorized_client`, so a tenant who
#: authorized "gmail.modify calendar" (per docs/GOOGLE_WORKSPACE.md, Task 12)
#: and then had this probe silently ask for a DIFFERENT scope string (e.g.
#: gmail.readonly) would get "domain-wide delegation is not authorized" on a
#: correctly-configured tenant -- the exact failure this constant exists to
#: prevent. This standalone endpoint has no plugin-manifest context of its own
#: (it is not exclusively called by google_workspace's setup form), so it
#: cannot read `delegated_scope` from a manifest here; keeping one named
#: constant, referenced by comment from Task 12's manifest, is the safeguard.

#: The scope the service account's OWN (non-delegated) identity mints with:

#: scope covers the whole self-identity half of the plugin (see
#: docs/GOOGLE_WORKSPACE.md, which explains this to the admin so nobody
#: "fixes" it into three narrower scopes that then have to be authorized
#: separately).
#:
#: It lives HERE, with the Google-keyed provisioner, and is written onto
#: `OAuthConnection.scopes` at provision time -- `oauth/tokens.py`'s
#: `_mint_service_account` reads the row. That module is shared grant
#: machinery for every provider; a Google URL hardcoded in it (as there was
#: until this branch's final review) would silently hand the SECOND
#: `service_account` provider a Google Drive scope.
_GOOGLE_SELF_SCOPE = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"


#: The cheapest read that proves, independently for EACH capability the tenant
#: actually submitted, that the credentials work: when a Shared Drive was
#: configured, that "the service account was actually added as a member" (a
#: service account can mint a token for a Shared Drive it was never shared
#: with, and Drive answers that with a 404/403 on this call, not on the mint);
#: when a delegated mailbox was configured, that domain-wide delegation is
#: actually authorized, via a delegated Gmail profile read -- for EVERY listed
#: mailbox, not just the first. Domain-wide delegation is authorized per
#: service account and scope, so one mailbox does prove *delegation*; it does
#: not prove the other addresses exist or are spelled correctly, and a deleted,
#: suspended or misspelled address at index >= 1 is otherwise introduced behind
#: a fully green setup screen and only discovered later as a mailbox whose
#: Gmail/Calendar tools all fail. The probes are cheap
#: (`users/{mailbox}/profile` GETs) and `mint_delegated_token` caches the
#: tokens the bridge will want anyway, so this costs one round trip per
#: mailbox, once, at the moment an operator can still fix the typo.
#: Both probe families run when both capabilities are configured -- one
#: succeeding must never mask the other failing, since a tenant can easily
#: submit valid Drive credentials alongside a delegated-mailbox list that was
#: never authorized in the Admin Console. Mirrors microsoft365's
#: _prove_graph_access: an unconditional, capability-appropriate probe, not one
#: that a tools-only config can skip. When NEITHER capability is configured
#: there is nothing this credential is meant to reach yet, and minting a token
#: (which the caller already did) is the only proof available.
