"""The workspace's third queue, beside approvals and clarifications: what is
actually being worked on, across every department a member can see, plus the
one new way to put something on it (§14a.4, My Work task board).

`Task.state` is not something this module -- or anybody outside
`RunRepository.transition` -- ever sets by hand. A task is a live reflection of
the run underneath it (see `runtime/repository.py`), so "moving" a card between
columns here is not a write to `Task.state`; it is one of two things that are
already real: answering the run's question (`workspace/queue.py`), deciding its
approval (`approvals/repo.py`), or -- new here -- starting a fresh run at all.
There is no third write.

**Creating a task is starting a run, not inserting a row.** `create_task`
mirrors `collab/intake.py::route_to_team_lead` almost line for line: find the
department's team lead, open a task pinned to that lead, and hand
`enqueue_run` the task id so the engine does not open a second one when the
run picks it up. The one difference is honesty in the other direction --
`route_to_team_lead` accepts a headless department and leaves the handoff for
a human because inventing an assignee would hide that nobody is on it; a
member sitting at the board asking for a team lead that does not exist gets
told so immediately (`NoTeamLead`), because there is no human left to leave it
for.

**Attribution does not overload `created_by`.** That column already means "the
agent that opened this task" everywhere it is written
(`agent/engine.py`, `collab/intake.py`) and nothing reads it back yet -- adding
a second meaning to an unread column is how it becomes a landmine the day
something finally does read it. The member who asked for the work goes in
`payload["requested_by_member_id"]` instead, which is free-form by design and
already the place a task's origin lives.
