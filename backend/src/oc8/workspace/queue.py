"""The only legal way to read or answer a `Clarification` for a HUMAN (§0.B, §4).

The other half of the queue, and the half with no screen at all today. A run that
stopped to ask something sits in `waiting_for_input`, and the one way to answer it
is `POST /runs/{run_id}/answer`, gated on `run:control` -- a permission in no seat
vocabulary. So the person whose answer the agent is waiting for is precisely the
person who cannot give it. That admin door is left exactly as it is (§4); this is
the departmental one beside it.

**Where a clarification stands.** `Clarification.agent_id` is NOT NULL
(`models/run.py:71`) and `Agent.department_id` is NOT NULL, so the department is
one join away and the row needs no column of its own. That is not the same
decision as `approval_request.department_id`, which is DENORMALISED on purpose:
an approval outlives the state it was raised in and must not move when its agent
does, whereas a clarification is answered inside the run that asked it -- minutes,
not weeks -- and there is nothing to pin.

**No tenant-wide clarification exists.** Every one has an agent, so unlike an
approval there is no `department_id IS NULL` bucket here. A caller with an empty
scope therefore sees nothing at all, and that is the whole of the rule.
