"""The only legal way to load or list an `Agent` for a human's departmental
READ (§0.B of the department-scoped-agent-authority design).

Modelled directly on `approvals/repo.py` -- see that module's docstring for why
a funnel exists at all rather than a discipline every future screen is expected
to remember on its own. `tests/agents/test_reads_go_through_the_scoped_
repository.py` is the sweep that makes walking around this file, for `Agent` or
`Department`, a decision somebody has to write a sentence for rather than a
typo nobody notices.

`tenant_wide` is a caller-resolved flag and deliberately NOT `scope.
is_unrestricted`: the latter is `approval:view_any`, an auditor's grant that has
nothing to do with reading agents. The caller (a route behind `require_
departmental(perm(AGENT, VIEW))`, once wired) resolves `tenant_wide` itself from
`perm(AGENT, VIEW) in authority.tenant_wide` -- the same RESOLVED-permission read
every other gate in this codebase uses, never `role_has(...)`.

    Consistency plan's uniform search/filter/group/pagination contract (spec
    §1.1). Returns `(rows, total_count)`; a caller that omits `limit` gets
    every visible row, ordered as before (oldest first, or grouped), with
    `total_count == len(rows)` -- there is no page to count against.

    `department_id` INTERSECTS the scope and never widens it -- the department
    picker on the screen, not a second door. Asking for a department outside
    scope returns `([], 0)`, never a 403: a 403 there would confirm that
    department exists to a caller who has no business finding out.

    Empty scope and not tenant-wide returns `([], 0)` before any statement is
    built, same shape as `approvals/repo.py::visible_approvals` -- `WHERE
    department_id IN ()` is not valid SQL, so skipping the filter when the set
    is empty is the natural way to write this, and it fails OPEN (every agent
    in the tenant) if written that way. The early return is what keeps it
    failing CLOSED instead.

    The tenant Assistant is never listed. It is auto-provisioned, has no
    configurable anything, and is reached through its own door (`GET /assistant`,
    which looks it up by the flag and not through here) -- so on every screen a
    person browses agents on it is one more row they cannot act on and are
    invited to try. Filtered here rather than on each screen because this
    function is the single funnel every one of those screens goes through

    An explicit `select()` rather than `db.get()`, and for the same reason that
    module gives: this load is a security boundary, and `Session.get` can return
    an already-loaded instance out of the identity map without issuing SQL at
    all -- the one thing a boundary check must never skip.

    `include_tenant_assistant` is off by default, matching `visible_agents`: the
    Assistant is not something a person manages, so every agent screen 404s on
    it. Exactly one caller passes True -- `POST /chat/sessions`
    (`api/v1/chat.py`), which has ALREADY established through
    `_assistant_visible` that this caller holds `copilot:manage` and that this
    id is the tenant's Assistant. It is a parameter and not a second function
