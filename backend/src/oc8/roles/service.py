"""Composing a role, and handing it to somebody (§6).

**The only module that writes `role` or `role_permission`.** Every refusal in
this file exists because the alternative is an administrator being told
something false: a permission silently dropped, a name that will never resolve,
a delete that demotes forty people, or a caller handing out authority he does
not hold himself.

**Nothing here commits.** Services flush; the caller commits. That is the house
rule, and on this path it is load-bearing rather than stylistic: `PUT /roles/{id}`
DELETEs the old grant set and INSERTs the new one, and a commit between the two
would unbind `app.tenant_id` for the rest of the transaction -- the INSERTs would
then match no RLS policy and affect zero rows, leaving the role holding nothing
and the response saying it worked.

**Two refusals are not what they look like.**

* The BUILT-IN NAME check is not the unique index restated. Globex has exactly
  one `role` row, so on that tenant `operator` is a free name -- the index would
  admit it, and the row would then be ignored by the resolver for ever, because
  `builtin` is false and the code table is never consulted for a tenant row. An
  administrator would have composed a role called `operator` that grants what he
  ticked, while every screen in the product says `operator` means something else.
* The DELEGATABLE check runs here AND in the resolver, and the duplication is
  deliberate. Here it names the offender to the person who ticked it; there it
  makes a row that arrived by restore or by psql inert. Neither is redundant:
  drop the first and an admin is told nothing, drop the second and a row nobody
  validated decides.

    The tenant predicate is written out although RLS applies it: this row decides
    what a person may do, and a read that would cross tenants on an unbound
    session is not a read to leave implicit. `deleted_at` likewise --
    `SoftDeleteMixin` adds no filter, so a deleted role is otherwise perfectly
    editable and perfectly assignable.

    **`for_update=True` is what makes a revocation a revocation.** `update_role`
    is read-then-DELETE-then-INSERT, and under READ COMMITTED two of those
    interleave into a result neither administrator asked for. Reproduced against
    Postgres 15 before this argument existed, with the real
    `uq_role_permission (role_id, permission)` index:

    * *"take everything away"* concurrent with *"add `audit:view`"* answered 200
      to both and revoked nothing -- the second transaction's DELETE blocked on
      the first's row locks, re-evaluated, matched zero rows, and then inserted
      alongside grants its own snapshot could not see;
    * two disjoint edits merged into their UNION, which is the exact failure
      `UpdateRoleRequest`'s docstring justifies the replacement shape by
      preventing;
    * two overlapping edits -- one administrator double-clicking Save is enough
      -- raised a bare `UniqueViolation` out of the INSERT and answered 500.

    And in the first two the audit event states a diff that did not happen,
    because `before` was read before the lock existed.

    `populate_existing=True` because the role may already be in this session's
    identity map: an administrator editing a role he holds himself has had it
    loaded by the resolver, and a locking SELECT that returned the cached
    attributes would take the lock and then compute the diff from the stale copy,
    which is the defect wearing a lock.

    **It locks ONE row, and only the row being written.** `?reassignTo=`'s target
    is read, never written, so it is deliberately NOT locked: two administrators
    each deleting a role while naming the other's as the target would otherwise
    take the two row locks in opposite orders, and a deadlock is a worse defect
    than the stale read it would be closing.

    **`FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, not `FOR UPDATE`, and the difference is a deadlock.**
    `role_permission` and `org_member` both carry a composite foreign key into
    `role`, so every INSERT of a grant and every assignment of a person takes an
    implicit `FOR KEY SHARE` on the role row. `FOR UPDATE` conflicts with that;
    `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` does not, and it still conflicts with itself, which is the
    only exclusion this needs. With `FOR UPDATE` the deletion path acquires the
    two in opposite orders and Postgres aborts one of them: two administrators
    each deleting a role while naming the other's as `?reassignTo=` would hold a
    lock on their own role and wait for a KEY SHARE on the other's. That is the
    worse defect this whole argument is about, reached by closing the smaller one
    with the bigger lock.
