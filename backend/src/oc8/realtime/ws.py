#: The socket carries the ACTIVITY FEED, live, as free text: `activity.logged`
#: ships `message` and `detail` verbatim, and among its producers are
#: `control_tools.py` ("Entscheidung angefragt: {question}", with `context[:500]`
#: as detail -- the very question `GET /clarifications` now scopes),
#: `agent/engine.py` ("Operator: {msg}", "{agent} completed: {task_text}") and
#: `note_focus` (what an agent is working on right now).
#:
#: `GET /activity`, which serves the same rows over HTTP, has always been
#: `run:view`. The socket asked for nothing but a valid token, which cost nothing
#: while every account in the system was an administrator -- and this slice is
#: what creates a population that is NOT: a `member` holds `frozenset()` and needs
#: no seat at all, so he 403'd at `/activity` and was simultaneously joined to the
#: tenant-wide fan-out carrying its contents. Same rows, same permission.
#:
#: Not per-department rooms: that is §10 item 5 and slice 2. This makes the
#: socket's audience exactly the HTTP route's, which is the claim §9 already
#: makes ("this slice adds no leak") and did not hold for the socket.
