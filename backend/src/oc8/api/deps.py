    That was reachable, not theoretical: the token handed to a nanoclaw container

    """Gate a route on what the caller may DO, rather than on what it is called.

    Naming the permission instead of the roles is what makes a new role possible
    without editing every route, and what stops a route admitting a role by
    accident -- `require_role("org_admin", "member")` guarded one endpoint with a
    role name that is issued to nobody and is not in `BUILTIN_ROLES`, so an
    ordinary operator was refused there while the code read as if two roles were
    welcome. Nothing in a role list is checkable; a permission is.

    An unknown permission string raises at IMPORT time rather than at request
    time. A typo would otherwise produce a route that admits nobody -- including
    `org_admin`, who holds every permission that exists -- and that failure looks
    exactly like a deliberate lockout.

    **What the caller holds is now RESOLVED rather than read off the token.**
    `role_has(principal.role, permission)` answers "what does this role NAME
    grant", which is the wrong question the moment an administrator can assign a
    tenant-defined role: `org_member.role_id` is an override, and a gate that
    keeps asking the code table is a gate no demotion reaches. The two other
    things about the line are unchanged -- one permission, no resource, tenant-
    wide -- which is precisely why every `:manage` permission is refused to a
    tenant-defined role (`NEVER_DELEGATABLE`, decision C).

    `request` and `db` are the only additions to the signature, and they cost
    nothing measurable: all 110 permission-gated routes already resolve `get_db`,
    so this opens no session anywhere -- it runs on the connection and inside the
    transaction the route already has. `authority_for_principal` memoises on
    `request.state`, so a route carrying this gate and `require_departmental`
    pays for one lookup rather than two.

    **One statement, and two for a caller with an assignment.** That is the
    measured number rather than the hoped-for one:
    `test_the_gate_costs_one_statement_and_an_assignment_costs_two` counts EVERY
    statement the resolver issues, not the ones that mention a particular table.
    An earlier version of that test filtered on `"org_member"` and so reported
    one while three were running -- a three-table LEFT JOIN over the seat tables
    among them, filling a field no module read.

    `_dep.__qualname__` still contains `require_permission`, which is what
    `test_every_route_is_governed._guards` reads, and the closure still holds the
    permission string for `_closed_over_permission`.

    of `require_permission`: only the routes that can be reached from a seat go
    looking for one, and the other 110 never load a seat they have no use for.

    `or_tenant_wide` exists for exactly one caller today: `chat.py`'s five
    session routes, which resolve a `HumanActor` (for its `member`/`scope`,
    used for session OWNERSHIP) via `require_departmental(perm(AGENT, VIEW))`
    even for a caller who holds no `agent:view` seat anywhere, as long as they
    hold `copilot:use` tenant-wide -- see `_assistant_visible`. It is boxed in
    a 1-tuple and read back through a local inside `_dep` rather than closed
    over directly: `test_every_route_is_governed._closed_over_permission`
    returns the FIRST string-valued freevar cell it finds on the closure, and

    an unboxed second string parameter could nondeterministically be picked up

    pinned on.

    Both gates now read the same `Authority`, once per request, memoised -- so

    read it from.

    What it yields is the resolved `HumanActor`, and what it does NOT do is
    narrow anything. The row narrowing belongs to `approvals/repo.py` and
    `decide_approval`, because a gate can only answer "at all" -- it runs
    before any row is loaded and has no department to check against.

    Do NOT commit in here. `scope_for_principal` does not, on purpose: a
