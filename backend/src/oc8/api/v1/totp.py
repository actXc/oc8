#: hole -- holding a valid bearer token (of either kind) already IS the
#: authorization this route needs, since member_id is derived from the
#: caller's own principal, never a path parameter, so no other member's data
#: is ever exposed. A full session gains nothing from calling this: with no
#: TOTP credential enrolled it gets a 401 like anyone else, and if enrolled
#: it only re-mints its OWN session at its OWN unchanged role, or spends its

#: refused with a 403 before this handler ever runs -- there is no login-time
#: use case this route serves. The profile page's own read, "is the CALLING,
#: already-fully-authenticated member enrolled", needs no operator
#: permission: it is not tenant administration, it is self-inspection, and
#: member_id is derived from the caller's own principal, never a path
#: parameter, so no other member's enrollment state is ever exposed.

#: backup code and minting a fresh set. What makes that safe without an
#: operator permission is that it can only ever act on the caller's OWN
#: credential (member_id from principal, never a path parameter) and only
#: once one already exists (404 otherwise) -- a member regenerating their
