"""Live KPI reads for one agent, one department, or the whole tenant -- see
backend/src/oc8/kpis/aggregate.py for how the numbers are computed.

The agent- and department-scoped routes are `require_departmental` -- READ
graduates for any live seat, mirroring `agents.py::get_agent` and
`departments.py::get_department` exactly, including their `visible_agent`/
`visible_department` narrow: the door only proves the caller holds
`agent:view`/`department:view` SOMEWHERE, so the row itself still has to be
proven visible before its numbers go out, or a Sales-seated caller could read
Engineering's KPIs by id even though `GET /agents/{id}` would 404 the same
request. Both 404 identically for "no such row" and "exists outside scope",
the same oracle guard those two reads already use.

`GET /kpis` is tenant-wide-only (`statistics:view`, gated by
`require_permission`, never `require_departmental`) -- see
`oc8.authz.permissions.STATISTICS` for why this is its own resource rather
than folded into AGENT/DEPARTMENT: it is the one endpoint that can span every
agent and department in the tenant in a single request.

    Ungrouped returns a bare `KPIDTO`-shaped dict (`response_model` is left
    unset -- see `schemas/kpi.py` -- because the grouped shape below is a
    different DTO entirely and FastAPI cannot express the union cleanly).

    `group_by=agent`/`department` enumerates the group values THIS TENANT
    actually has (see `_group_id_query`, including why departments come from
    the `department` table rather than from `Agent.department_id`) and calls
    `compute_kpis` once per value, capped at `MAX_GROUPS`.
    Soft-deleted agents are excluded from the enumeration -- same set
    `agents.repo.visible_agents` lists by default -- which is why a
    department's grouped-by-agent rows will not sum to that department's own
    total once an agent under it has been deleted: the department-scoped
    total (`compute_kpis`'s own deliberate choice, kpis/aggregate.py) keeps
    counting a deleted agent's historical runs, but there is no live agent
    row left to enumerate a breakdown row for it. Not a bug in either place.

    `group_by=day`/`week`/`month` buckets `[date_from, date_to]` in Python,
    defaulting to the last 30 days when neither bound is given -- an
    unbounded tenant-wide time series would be needlessly expensive -- and
    calls `compute_kpis` once per bucket. See `compute_kpis`'s own docstring
    for why this grouping lives here rather than as a second SQL code path
    inside every one of its six sub-queries. `range_start` is floored to the
    grouping unit (`_floor_to_unit`) before bucketing starts, and the number
    of buckets a request can produce is capped (`MAX_BUCKETS`) rather than
