"""The other half of the workspace queue: questions an agent parked mid-run (§5).

There was no endpoint for these at all. A run that stopped to ask something sits
in `waiting_for_input`, and the one way to answer it was `POST /runs/{id}/answer`
-- gated on `run:control`, a permission in no seat vocabulary. So the person whose
answer the agent was waiting for was precisely the person who could not give it.

That admin door is left exactly as it is (§4). This is the departmental one
beside it, and every rule it obeys lives in `workspace/queue.py`: the department
comes from the agent, `may_decide` (not `may_view`) gates the answer, and "no such
question" and "not yours" are the same 404.
