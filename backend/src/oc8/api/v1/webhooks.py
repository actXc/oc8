"""Generic inbound webhook ingress for kind='webhook' Triggers (§8.4 generic
webhooks).

Unlike `POST /events/{source}` (events.py -- GitHub-specific, HMAC-verified,
one Python adapter per source), a webhook-kind Trigger's own unguessable
token in the URL is its entire auth boundary. The pattern this copies is
n8n's Webhook node: one URL per trigger, any caller, any JSON body, no
per-source parsing. Built because oc8's first real target (Odoo's native
"Send Webhook Notification" automation action) sends a bare, unsigned POST
with no way to add a header or a signature at all -- so a signature-based
scheme is not just unnecessary here, it is unusable for that caller.
