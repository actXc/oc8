"""Who may do what, readable (§5.2, §17.2-6).

The permission layer decides correctly and says almost nothing. An operator who
is refused gets `403 requires permission: plugin:manage` and no way to find out
which role holds it, whether their own role is the one they think, or whether
their token carries a role the deployment recognises at all. That last case is
the one that hurts: an unrecognised role holds nothing, so the symptom is a
screen that is simply empty everywhere, which reads as a broken product rather
than as a mapping nobody finished.

So this returns the whole STATIC model rather than only the caller's slice:
every built-in role, every permission, and which of them the caller holds. None
of that is secret -- it is the same table a reader of `oc8.authz.permissions`
sees -- and hiding it would buy nothing while making every 403 undiagnosable.

It therefore carries NO permission of its own, which was not the first attempt:
gating it on `settings:view` locked out precisely the caller it exists for, since
an unrecognised role holds nothing at all. A test written to assert the intent
caught the implementation contradicting it. Authentication is still required --
the caller's own role is part of the answer -- but no grant is.

**And that reason has to stay literally true now that roles can be tenant-defined.**
So this endpoint answers about the CALLER and about the compiled-in model, and
about nobody else: which roles this tenant has invented, and who holds them, is
`GET /roles`, behind `role:view`. Otherwise this would be the one route on which
a seatless employee could read the whole company's authority map -- a better
reconnaissance target than most of what the layer protects -- and 12c40e6's
decision would have to be argued again with the opposite answer.

Two more things it now says, and one it survives:

* **The SOURCE of the caller's authority.** "Aus Ihrer Rolle `operator`" and
  "aus der Rolle *Freigabe Vertrieb*, die Ihnen zugewiesen wurde" are different
  sentences, and only one of them tells somebody who to go and ask.
  `callerPermissions` is the RESOLVED set rather than `permissions_for(token)`,
  which for exactly the population this slice creates would have rendered "you
  hold 52 of 52" to somebody refused at 48 of them.
* **Human and agent roles as two lists.** The backend sorts built-ins by name,
  so `agent_default` -- whose entire content is `tool:read|write|send` -- was the
  LEFTMOST column of the governance matrix, next to `plugin:manage`, as though a
  person could be given it.
* **A database that does not answer.** The read runs inside a SAVEPOINT and its
  failure degrades to `authorityUnavailable: true` with the static model intact.
  `get_db` yields inside `tenant_session`, which COMMITS on the way out, so a
  failed statement leaves the transaction aborted and a plain `try/except` in
  this handler would still 500 after it had returned its careful fallback. The
  screen that explains a refusal must never be the first thing to die.

Read-only, deliberately. The editor for tenant roles is `api/v1/roles.py`, gated
on `role:manage`; this stays the page that explains the model to whoever it just
refused, and gains no button that would need a permission to press.

    #: carries `org_admin`, which holds nothing company-wide BY DESIGN"* -- both
    #: halves false, and it sends the administrator to look at seats when the fix
