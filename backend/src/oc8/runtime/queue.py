"""Redis Streams job queue for durable runs.

Backed by a Redis Stream with a consumer group so that a worker crashing
mid-run does not lose the message: unacked entries stay in the group's
pending entries list (PEL) and can be reclaimed via `claim_stale`.

An entry's idle time in the PEL is reset by nothing but XACK and XCLAIM -- it
measures silence from its consumer, not the age of the work. A consumer still
working an entry therefore has to say so with `touch`; how often, and how much
silence means death, is the worker's policy, not the queue's.
