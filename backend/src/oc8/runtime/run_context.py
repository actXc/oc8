"""Concurrency-safe writes to ``agent_run.context``.

Two writers share that JSONB column: the executor records a run's outcome, and
the approvals endpoint records an operator's decision on a run that is still
going. Both used to read it into Python, merge, and write the whole object back
-- a read-modify-write with no lock in between, so whichever committed second
erased the other's key. The decision is the one that matters: the operator sees
"approved" and the action never happens, rarely and unreproducibly.

The fix is to stop reading it into Python at all. Each function here merges
inside ONE statement, so Postgres' own row locking serialises them: under READ
COMMITTED a second UPDATE waits for the first to commit and then re-evaluates
its expression against the NEW row. Neither writer needs to know the other
exists, which is the property an explicit lock would not have given us -- both
sides would have had to remember to take it.

`run_cancellation` and `run_message` avoid the same hazard by being side tables.
This column predates that pattern and is read by too many callers to move now.
