    """Say we are still working this entry, for as long as we are.

    THE DEFECT, measured live 2026-08-02: `heartbeat()` wrote the AgentRun row
    and nothing else, while a stream entry's idle time is reset by nothing but
    XACK/XCLAIM. With two workers up, the other worker's claim_stale reclaimed a
    perfectly live entry after five minutes and failed the run as "lease lost" --
    run 019fc303, dead at 00:05:03 with oc8-nora-agent-019fc303 still Up and
    still working on a result nobody would read. Not a race with two workers: a
    guarantee, for every run longer than the window.

    It lives here rather than in the executor's heartbeat because `_process`
    owns the entry and its ack, and ownership of the claim has to sit with
    ownership of the ack -- threading entry ids down into the executor would put
    two modules in charge of one lease. It also covers every arm (recovery and
    the ingestion handler as well as execute_run) and the whole of the handler,
    where the executor's heartbeat wraps only the runtime call.

    The beat is `reconcile.HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`, read live so the queue's clock and
    the database's stay literally the same clock. The two SPANS are deliberately
    not the same, and it would be wrong to claim they are: this one covers the
    whole arm, the heartbeat only the runtime call, so everything execute_run
    does before and after that call is renewed here and silent there. That is
    survivable only because neither signal is trusted alone -- inside those spans
    the database decider can look at a working run and see silence, and
    `recover_reclaimed` is where the two are made to agree before anything dies.

    WHAT CATCHES A WEDGE -- a handler that is alive and never finishes -- now
    that this renews honestly for as long as the handler runs. Nothing here
    does, and nothing here can: from the queue's side a wedge is indistinguishable
    from work, which is the whole reason the five-minute reclaim had to go. It is
    caught one level down, by each arm's own bound on the WORK, and that is
    per-arm rather than universal:

    * container runtimes: `isolated.DockerIsolatedRuntime` bounds `driver.wait`
      (agent_max_steps * 60) and tears the container down; the nanoclaw plugin
      has its own deadline plus startup and heartbeat watchdogs.
    * the in-process runtime (agent_isolation is on -- container is the
      DEFAULT -- unless a deployment turns it off): every step is bounded,
      the model call by
      modelrouter.streaming's httpx timeout and the tool call by
      `agent.mcp_client.MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, which existed only after
      this defect was reviewed: before it, one unanswered tool call hung the run,
      the agent and this worker for ever. `agent_max_steps` bounds the count.
    * the INGESTION stream (`knowledge.worker.ingest_job`, run through this same
      function): nothing. Its jobs have no heartbeat and no reconciler sweep, so
      a connector that never returns leaves `IngestionJob.status == 'running'`
      with nothing able to close it. Accepted knowingly: first-party connectors
      bound every fetch (`knowledge.connectors.fetcher`, httpx timeouts), so
      this needs a third-party connector plugin to wedge -- and what the old
      five-minute reclaim did here was not a net either. It failed the job as
      "worker died mid-ingestion" while the sync went on writing chunks, which
      it also did to every honest sync that took longer than five minutes.

    The reclaim below still catches the case it was actually built for: a worker
    that DIES stops renewing, because a dead process renews nothing.
