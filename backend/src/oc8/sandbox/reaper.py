"""Remove agent containers a dead worker left behind.

`teardown` sits in a `finally`, which covers a failing run but not a killed
process: restarting the worker mid-run skips it entirely. Observed live,
2026-07-27 -- two agent containers still running 40+ minutes after their runs had
finished, each holding a live run-scoped token and able to keep writing to the
customer's system. The `finally` is where teardown BELONGS; this is the sweep
for the one case it structurally cannot cover.

The dangerous half is not leaving a container behind, it is killing the wrong
one, so the rule is deliberately narrow: remove a container only when the run
named in its own name is FINISHED. That makes the sweep safe with several
workers on one host without any coordination between them -- a sibling's live run
is not finished, so its containers are invisible to this. Anything we cannot
resolve to a finished run is left alone: unknown is not the same as done.
