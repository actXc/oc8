"""The one place that knows how to open a secured SMTP connection, plus the
credential-type test for smtp_server (unified credentials framework).

`smtp_connection` is deliberately the SINGLE source of truth for "how do we
dial an SMTP server": both the admin-facing "Test" button (`validate_smtp`
below, via `test_credential`) and the actual send path
(`oc8.mail.send.send_mail`) go through it. Two independent copies of this
logic would let "Test" and "Send" disagree about whether a given host is
reachable or safe -- an admin would get a green tick from a connection
shaped differently to the one that later carries a real password-reset
link.

Test itself opens a real connection and, if credentials were given,
authenticates -- the cheapest real proof the server is reachable and the
credentials work, without sending an actual message. It mirrors
`validate_s3` (`capas/s3_source/credential.py`): an async callable taking
the resolved field values, raising on any failure. `test_credential`
(`oc8.credentials.service`) awaits it and converts whatever comes out into
a `ValueError` carrying the message, so an `smtplib` exception here reaches
the admin with the server's own wording (e.g. the 535 auth rejection)
rather than a flattened "test failed".

    check_hostname=False, CERT_NONE), i.e. encryption with no proof of who
    is on the other end -- which is exactly the attacker-in-the-middle a
    password-reset link must not be handed to.

    The deliberate consequence: an internal relay presenting a self-signed
    or private-CA certificate now fails, loudly, at "Test" time rather than
    silently sending reset links into an unauthenticated tunnel. The two
    supported answers are to put that CA in the container's trust store, or
    to set the credential's `use_tls` to "false" -- an explicit, visible,
    admin-owned choice to speak plaintext on a trusted network, instead of
    an invisible middle state that looks encrypted but proves nothing.

    anonymous internal relays are real. They stay supported -- they just
    have to say out loud which of the two they are.)
