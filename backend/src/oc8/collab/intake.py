"""An accepted handoff becomes work on somebody's desk.

§14a.3 says an intake "materializes as a new task assigned to the team-lead
agent, who decomposes it per delegation". Until now `accept_handoff` only moved
a status and recorded a `target_task_id` **the caller had to supply**. Nothing
created the task, nothing found the lead, nothing started a run — so accepting a
handoff produced a row and no work. Measured before writing this: 413 tasks in
the database, none delegated, and no run has ever had `source="delegation"`.

That also explains what a team lead is FOR here, which is worth saying because
the obvious answer is wrong. Two agents already work one queue in parallel: the
record claim keeps them off each other, and adding a coordinator to hand out
tickets would cost two runs per ticket and buy nothing. A lead earns its place
where work arrives as ONE lump that somebody has to cut up — which is exactly
what a handoff from another department is.

Deliberately at the request boundary rather than inside `accept_handoff`:
enqueueing a run commits, and a domain function that quietly commits its
caller's transaction is a trap this codebase has been bitten by before.
