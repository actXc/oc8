"""The only legal way to load or list an approval for a HUMAN (§0.B, §4).

Not a convenience layer. `api/v1/feed.py` has listed approvals filtered on status
alone since the day it was written, and that is not because anybody decided the
whole company should see them -- it is because nothing forced a new list to say
whose they are. So the term lives here, `decide_approval` asks it again, and
`tests/approvals/test_reads_go_through_the_scoped_repository.py` fails the build
for a `select(m.ApprovalRequest)` written anywhere else.

The one shape this module exists to make unwritable:

    if scope.viewable:
        stmt = stmt.where(ApprovalRequest.department_id.in_(scope.viewable))

`WHERE department_id IN ()` is not valid SQL, so skipping the filter when the set
is empty is the natural way to write it -- and it fails OPEN, handing a seatless
employee every approval in the tenant. An empty scope returns an empty list here,
before any statement is built.
