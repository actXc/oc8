"""Policy Decision Point.

Pure functions over the department frame (the ceiling) and the agent narrowing
(per-agent tightening). The algebra is fixed (tech-spec §5.3):

    effective = department_frame ∩ agent_narrowing

For a tool key the frame grants, an agent narrowing may only *remove*
tools/rights or *lower* an approval threshold — never widen. `narrowing_within_frame`
enforces that at write time; `authorize_tool` enforces it again at decision
time (defense in depth).

A tool key the frame does NOT grant is a different case: an agent may still
be given that tool directly (an agent-exclusive grant, invisible to sibling
agents in the same department), since there is no frame policy to widen
beyond -- the narrowing entry simply becomes that tool's whole policy. See
`effective_tool_policies`'s second loop and `narrowing_within_frame`'s
`key not in frame_tools` branch.

Frame / narrowing JSON shape (stored on ``department.frame`` / ``agent.narrowing``):

    {
      "tools": {
        "<tool_key>": {
          "enabled": bool,
          "read": bool, "modify": bool,
          "approval_eur": int | null,  # threshold at or above which modify needs approval
          "approval_actions": ["modify", ...],  # rights and/or tool keys that always need a human
          "conditions": [  # generic "with limits" rules -- see `Condition` below
            {"attribute": "order_value", "datatype": "number", "operator": ">",
             "value": 5000, "then": "require_approval"}
          ]
        }
      },
      "kbs": ["<kb_id>", ...],
      "memory": {"department": ["read","write"], "company": ["read"]}
    }

`conditions` is deliberately generic and tool-agnostic: it does not know about
euros or Odoo. Which `attribute` names are actually evaluable for a given tool
call is a CAPA-declared concern (see `capas/manifest.py`'s
`GuardrailAttribute`), not a PDP one -- this module only ever sees an already
name-keyed `attributes` mapping (`authorize_tool_call`'s `attributes` param)
and a list of conditions to check it against. `approval_eur`/`approval_actions`
remain as they were (a numeric-threshold-only, tool-agnostic-but-narrower
mechanism); they are not being replaced or reinterpreted -- `conditions` is
the generalization new callers should reach for, kept alongside rather than
instead of, so existing saved data keeps meaning exactly what it always did.
