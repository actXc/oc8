"""Which departments a HUMAN stands in, and the actor every human funnel takes (§2).

Until this module there was no term in the system in which "his department, and
not the whole company's" could be true. `GET /approvals` filtered on status
alone and handed back every pending approval in the tenant; `POST
/approvals/{id}/decision` checked a permission and never asked whose approval it
was; a person was five claims in a JWT with nowhere to stand.

**Three things this module is deliberately NOT.**

*Not a second RLS GUC.* `tests/db/test_organization_rls_pooled.py:26-38` documents
that once a pooled connection has bound a custom GUC with `is_local=true`, its
post-transaction reset value is `''` and not NULL for the life of that physical
connection -- migration 0015 exists because of exactly this. So "unset means a
system session" is unavailable here, and a department GUC would fail OPEN on
forget, which is the inverse of the property that makes `app.tenant_id`
trustworthy. The term lives in application code, in one funnel and one
repository, guarded by a source sweep.

*Not on the agent path.* `get_db` is untouched. It is `DbSession` in
`mcp_gateway.py`, `llm_gateway.py` and `internal_agent.py`, which is how the
runtime RAISES an approval; binding a scope there would break the 3000-EUR gate
the product is demoed on. Nothing in this module is imported by
`authorize_tool`, the department frame, or agent narrowing.

*Not a permission check.* A scope answers WHERE, never WHAT. `require_departmental`
answers what (does this caller hold `approval:decide` at all), the scope answers
where (in which departments), and `decide_approval` asks the scope again as
defence in depth. Keeping the two apart is why an `auditor` -- unrestricted by
`approval:view_any` -- is still refused at the decide door: he sees every
department and decides in none, which is two flags here and not one.

    The third door onto the same question. `scope_for_principal` answers it for
    an HTTP caller and `scope_for_binding` for a messenger sender; this one
    answers it for code holding nothing but an `org_member.id` -- an agent run
    asking, mid-run, what the human who started it could have reached
    (`agent/control_tools.py`'s `_member_may_reach_department`). That guard used
    to hand-roll its own answer as "`all_departments`, or a live seat in exactly
    this department", which is the ROW term only: on a fresh tenant `_upsert_member`
    mints members with neither, so the honest answer there was "nobody may reach
    anything", and cross-department delegation was dead for everyone whose
    authority came from a role.

    Three terms, in the same order and with the same meaning as
    `scope_for_principal`:

    * an ASSIGNED role's `approval:view_any` / `approval:decide_any`, read out
      of the role table rather than off a token, because that is the term an
      administrator can grant and revoke;
    * `all_departments` on the row;
    * live seats.

    `token_role` is the one term that CANNOT be recovered from storage -- for a
    member with no assigned role the resolved answer is `permissions_for(token.role)`,
    and there is no token here. A caller that captured it at an authenticated
    moment (the chat API writes it into the run's context) may pass it; a caller
    that has none passes nothing and gets the row terms alone, which is the
