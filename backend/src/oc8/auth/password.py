"""Local password authentication utilities for Community single-instance deployments.

This module provides secure password hashing and verification using Argon2id,
the OWASP-recommended key derivation function. Community ships exactly one
identity provider -- this one -- so every member authenticates directly via
password.

Password hashes are stored in the OrgMember model and validated on login.
Never log or expose plaintext passwords, hashes, or tokens. All operations
are fail-closed on any error.
