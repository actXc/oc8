"""Built-in runtime_adapter plugins auto-enabled for every tenant (§8.7).

Auto-enabled rather than surfaced through a plugin-marketplace/consent UI
(neither exists yet), mirroring `seed_builtin_model_providers`: these are
first-party runtimes shipping with oc8 itself, not a third-party plugin a
tenant needs to review before granting `sandbox:run`. Without this, `GET
/runtimes` -- and therefore every runtime picker, including at hire time --
would show only the two built-in defaults until an operator separately
installs each one via the Plugins page. Silently skipped (not an error) on a
deployment whose plugins path does not carry a given folder at all.
