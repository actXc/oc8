"""Poll-based ingress for an approval channel with no public webhook URL to
receive on (§5.6 addendum) -- e.g. `telegram_approvals` running on a
developer's machine with no tunnel, where Telegram can never reach
`POST /channels/{channel}/webhook/{tenant_id}`.

A channel opts in by implementing an optional `poll(*, offset) -> (updates,
next_offset)` method (duck-typed, like `ApprovalChannel.say` already is) --
core does not otherwise know or care which channels support this. Every
update it returns is handed to the SAME `oc8.channels.dispatch.process_inbound`
the webhook route calls, so an update is handled identically whichever way
it arrived.

Every database access below opens its OWN `tenant_session` rather than
sharing one across the tick. `tenant_session` binds `app.tenant_id` with
`set_config(..., is_local=true)` -- transaction-local -- and
`process_inbound` (via `bind_from_link`/`apply_decision`) already commits
or rolls back per update it processes. Sharing a session across multiple
updates would silently unbind RLS after the first one, the same failure
mode `oc8.mail.send.send_mail` was bitten by; this mirrors
`triggers.scheduler.run_scheduler_tick`'s own one-`tenant_session`-per-fire
shape instead.

Not a general-purpose distributed job: this assumes a single scheduler
replica. Telegram's own `getUpdates` offset semantics already make a stray
double-poll harmless (it just returns nothing new), so no additional
locking is added for the case this exists to solve -- a local dev machine.
