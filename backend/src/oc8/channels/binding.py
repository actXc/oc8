"""Linking a messenger account to an oc8 user, and unlinking it again (§5.6).

This is the part of an approval channel that decides whether it is safe at all.
A Telegram chat id is not a user; a WhatsApp phone number is a value anyone can
put in a message. If oc8 inferred the link from either, the bot's name plus a
spoofed number would be enough to approve a refund.

So the link is never inferred. An authenticated person asks oc8 for a code, sends
that code to the bot, and the bot exchanges it. Three properties make that hold:

* the code is single-use and short-lived, so a screenshot in a chat history is
  not a standing credential;
* it is compared in constant time, because it is a bearer token for the moments
  it is alive;
* an unknown sender is answered with nothing that tells them whether an account
  exists -- an error that distinguishes "no such code" from "code already used"
  is a probe oracle.

    `department_id` is a required keyword rather than an optional filter, and

    added next year cannot fan out to a whole tenant by omission. Until this
    slice the query filtered on tenant and channel alone, so a Head of Sales who
    had bound Telegram was messaged about Engineering's held tool calls -- with
    the title and the amount in the notification, which is a disclosure before
    anybody has decided anything.

    `department_id is None` means the approval is TENANT-WIDE (the budget
    incident), and reaches only the unrestricted. It must not be read as "no
    department filter": that is the same fail-open shape as skipping an empty
    `IN ()`.

    A binding is kept only when the person behind it is still present and either
    stands in every department or holds a live seat in this one. Three things
    earn their place: the INNER join (a binding whose `member_id` is NULL names
    nobody -- that is every row from before this slice, deliberately not
    grandfathered -- and an inner join drops it without a second predicate),
    `deleted_at IS NULL` (nothing writes it yet -- offboarding is §10 item 9 --
    but the predicate is what makes that a one-line change rather than an audit
    of every fan-out), and `revoked_at IS NULL` on the seat (a revoked approver
    stops being told on the next approval rather than on the next token).

    The orphan count below is the SIGNAL for that first one. Dropping every
    pre-slice binding is deliberate, and it is also silent: on the live system it
    is the demo's Telegram binding, which simply stops receiving announcements and
    withdrawals with nothing logged and `raise_approval` succeeding. The only
    trace was a comment in migration 0046. One small indexed count per announce
    buys a line that names the row and the fix.
