    Split into two sequential tenant_session transactions rather than one:
    the tenant GUC that backs RLS (`SET LOCAL app.tenant_id`) is
    transaction-local, so it cannot survive a mid-session commit -- that's
    why `run_source_sync` is flush-only. But the sync loop can run for a
    long time, and if the whole `queued -> running` flip only commits when
    the loop finishes, a reclaiming consumer (xautoclaim after the stream's
    idle window) sees the job as still `queued` under READ COMMITTED and
    `recover_ingestion` re-runs it concurrently -- duplicate KbChunk rows
    and a double cursor advance.

    So: claim first, in its own short transaction that commits before the
    long loop starts (session 1), then run the sync in a fresh transaction
    (session 2). Once session 1 commits, any reclaimer observes `running`
    and `recover_ingestion` correctly fails the job instead of re-running it.

    One difference, and it is not an oversight: `recover_reclaimed` refuses to
    fail a RUNNING run whose heartbeat is fresh, because a reclaim only proves a
    consumer stopped talking to Redis. There is no such second fact here -- an
    IngestionJob has no heartbeat; its `updated_at` is when it was CLAIMED, so
    reading it would fail every honest sync that runs longer than the window,
    which is exactly the defect that made all this necessary (run 019fc303,
    2026-08-02). So this arm still decides on one fact, and the exposure is a
    ten-minute Redis partition during a live sync: the job is marked failed
    while it goes on writing. Left alone rather than papered over -- giving
    ingestion a real heartbeat is the fix, and it is a slice of its own.
    Since 2026-08-02 the worker renews its claim while `ingest_job` runs, so
    reaching this at all now takes a dead worker or that partition, where it
    used to take five minutes of ordinary work."""
