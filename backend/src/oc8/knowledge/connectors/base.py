    Core resolves this with `getattr(connector, "attest_listing", None)` and

    evidence half of the runtime seam, and for the identical reason: a plugin
    loaded from outside this package only has to answer the name, not import
    core's type to prove it. It is a separate Protocol rather than a member of
    `Connector` so that the four shipped connectors stay structurally valid
    `Connector`s without growing a method they cannot honestly implement --
    declaring it on `Connector` would make the optional thing mandatory. It is
    NOT `@runtime_checkable`, so an `isinstance` against it raises at import of
    the first call rather than quietly answering a question it cannot answer:
    a class can satisfy the name and still be lying, which is why the refusals
    in `reconcile.py` exist.

    `discover()` is not this method and must never be used as one. `discover()`
    answers a PREVIEW question and is allowed to be a sample -- `website.py`
    returns exactly one item, the start URL -- so attaching a completeness claim
    to it would make every preview call a deletion authority.

    An implementation raises rather than attesting an empty set when the API
    refuses it: a revoked grant answering `AUTHORITATIVE` with no URIs is the
    wire shape of "the customer deleted everything".
