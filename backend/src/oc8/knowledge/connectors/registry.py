"""Connector lookup (§11.2).

Two doors, on purpose:

* ``get_connector`` -- synchronous, **core connectors only**. Every tenant may
  use these, so it needs no tenant and cannot leak anything.
* ``resolve_connector`` -- asynchronous, tenant-scoped, and the only way to
  reach a connector contributed by a plugin.

A plugin's Python module is imported once per process, but a plugin install is
per tenant. So loading a plugin must never, by itself, make its connector usable:
``resolve_connector`` first establishes that *this* tenant has the plugin
installed **and enabled**, and only then looks at what that plugin contributed.
The reverse shape -- a flat process-global dict of usable connectors -- is the
one that produced this project's cross-tenant hook-registry Critical.

Unknown type, plugin not installed, plugin installed but not enabled, and plugin
failed to import all end the same way: ``ConnectorError``. Fail closed.
