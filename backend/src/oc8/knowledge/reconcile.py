"""What a sync may conclude from a connector's listing, and the tick that acts on it.

Two halves, deliberately split by what they are allowed to do.

**Observation** runs inside `run_source_sync` -- the single connector-agnostic
funnel, the only code that owns the cursor and the only code that knows whether
this sync actually worked. It stamps facts on rows and **never deletes**.

**Decision** runs in the sweep, on the worker's housekeeping timer. It performs
no network IO and calls no connector: it acts only on facts a sync already wrote.

**Core's permitted conclusions per attestation live here and nowhere else.** §3
of the design puts them in this docstring on purpose. The seam hands core a
`frozenset[str]` and one `Attestation` member -- never a `maxFiles`, a bucket or
a folder id -- and this is the one place that says what they mean:

* `AUTHORITATIVE` -- the listing is everything the source now holds, enumerated
  to the end of its pagination. A document this source previously delivered
  whose URI is absent is a **candidate**, not a corpse. Only this member
  forgives, only this member adopts an orphan and only this member advances
  `last_attested_sync_at`, because all three are claims about PRESENCE and it is
  the only member that can make one.
* `REMOVALS` -- exactly the URIs in `removed_uris` are candidates. Absence from
  the listing means nothing: it never claimed to have seen everything. So it
  never forgives an earlier mark and never attributes an unattributed row.
* `NONE` -- conclude nothing. A connector with no `attest_listing` at all, an
  explicit `NONE`, an exception and a timeout are one outcome, and it is the
  outcome that costs a customer nothing.

**Two facts must agree before a chunk dies**, and they are one SQL comparison:
`data_source.last_attested_sync_at >= kb_chunk.missing_since +
knowledge_missing_confirm_hours`. Fact A is that an attested listing once did
not contain the document; fact B is that a **second, later** attested sync of
the same source, at least the confirm window afterwards, also did not. The
separation is the point -- without it two syncs a minute apart during a
one-minute permissions blip count as two observations that agree. Say plainly
what this is: **the same witness twice, a day apart, not two independent
witnesses.** It defends against transient failure and not at all against
systematic failure, which is what the refusals below are for.

**The refusals all default to keeping the content.** An expired OAuth token, a
revoked bucket policy, a rotated credential and a folder id that no longer
resolves all look exactly like "the customer deleted everything"; a listing
built with a slightly different URI shape looks exactly like "the customer
replaced everything". Each refusal parks the source in `reconcile_state='held'`
with a note in words, marks nothing, and does not advance fact B. The customer
who really did empty a source has `DELETE /knowledge/sources/{id}`, and the note
says so -- a hold with no remedy named sends an operator hunting a bug in the
sweep.
