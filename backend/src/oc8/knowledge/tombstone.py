"""Taking a document back out of a knowledge base, in two phases.

Until this module existed a customer could put a document into a knowledge base
and never take it out: there was no DELETE anywhere on the knowledge API, so the
only removal path in the product was raw SQL against `kb_chunk`.

**Phase 1, tombstone.** `deleted_at` is set and the content and the embedding are
RETAINED. The chunk is out of retrieval and restorable by one UPDATE, so nothing
has been destroyed and nothing is written to the ledger.

**Phase 2, reduce.** The content is destroyed and the digest of what was
destroyed goes into the tenant's hash chain -- §12.5.1's rule that retention is
REDUCTION: the row survives as its own tombstone, only the ability to re-read it
is dropped.

Which phase runs when is rule 2 of the design: **a human's command is executed, a
machine's inference is held.** An operator DELETE reduces immediately and
irreversibly (that is the GDPR path, and a human named the object). A deletion
the system inferred -- from an attested listing, or from a re-ingest -- is
tombstoned now and reduced by the sweep only after a grace window, during which
`restore_document` brings it back.

**THE LOCK ORDER, and it is the same one everywhere in this slice:**

    kb_chunk  ->  data_source  ->  knowledge_base  ->  the tenant audit lock

Every path that removes knowledge takes these in that order, and each object only
counts the FIRST time it is acquired. `recompute_freshness` is where the middle
two are ordered (`data_source` before `knowledge_base`, deliberately, because
that is the order a sync already had), and `append_event` flushes before it takes
`pg_advisory_xact_lock` so the audit lock cannot arrive before a caller's row
work. `tests/knowledge/test_lock_order.py` traces the real statements of all six
paths and fails the build if one inverts.

It is written down because it was measured: `recompute_freshness` used to write
`knowledge_base` first and `data_source` second, which gave every operator path
and the sweep's own phase 1 the OPPOSITE order to a live sync, and Postgres
aborted the pair ("deadlock detected") on real rows with every flag off. The
abort is not symmetric either -- on the sync side it lands in bookkeeping that
runs after the documents are already ingested, so the cost of getting this wrong
was a whole sync's work, not a retried statement.

Two things that look like details and are not:

* `ck_kb_chunk_reduced_is_empty` means the three assignments that reduce a row --
  `content = ''`, `embedding = NULL`, `reduced_at` -- must travel in ONE
  statement together with `deleted_at`, or the statement raises. That is
  deliberate: a reduced row that still holds retrievable text is unrepresentable
  in the table, so "prove the document is gone" is a `count(*)` the customer can
  run rather than an audit of every path that might have forgotten to blank it.
* Every function here is flush-only and the caller owns the commit. Tenant
  isolation is a transaction-local Postgres GUC, so a commit inside one of these
  would unbind RLS and every later statement would silently see nothing.

    `source_ids` is named by the caller rather than derived from "every source
