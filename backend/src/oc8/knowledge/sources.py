"""Proving a data source's configuration before anything persists it (§11.2).

`POST /knowledge/sources` used to be the only way to make a source, so it was
also the only place that ran the two checks a source needs: `resolve_connector`
(is this connector type real, and may THIS tenant use it?) and the connector's
own `validate()` (does this configuration actually work, with these
credentials?). The plugin setup form's `oauth_provision` block then grew a
second, quieter way in -- an ORM row built by hand -- which ran neither. A
typo'd `connector_type` in a manifest became a dead row nobody noticed until
the first sync, and for Microsoft 365 the `GET /organization` call that proves
the Azure app's Graph permissions were actually admin-consented never ran at
all: minting a token proves the client secret and nothing else, and an app
registration with no consented permissions mints one happily and then 403s on
every real call.

One function, called by both writers. Read-only: it persists nothing and the
caller still owns both the row and the transaction.
