"""Turn a plugin's manifest data into domain rows (§13).

`skill`, `flow_template` and `tool_pack` plugins carry no code -- they are data
that has to become a Skill, a Flow, or MCP connections before anything can use
them. `agent_template` capas may also ship `skills/` (merged into `skill_pack`
by discovery); those skills materialise here on enable the same way. 
`department_template` has done agents since B2 via an explicit
`instantiate_department`; skill/flow/tool_pack materialise on **enable** instead,
because they have nothing to name or place and enable is where consent already
happens.

Three rules hold across all of them:

* **Idempotent.** Re-enabling (after a permission change, say) must not create a
  second copy.
* **Per tenant.** Rows are written for the enabling tenant only.
* **Non-destructive.** Disabling a plugin does NOT delete what it created.
  Toggling a plugin off must not silently destroy work built on top of it;
  removal is a separate, deliberate act.

A malformed data block is logged and skipped rather than raised: the enable
itself is what the operator asked for, and leaving them with a half-enabled
plugin because one guardrail string was wrong helps nobody.
