"""`guardrails/*.toml` library entries (design §3-4): a plugin's own library of
named, documented use-case guardrails, kept out of `plugin.toml` so the
manifest stays a readable teaching piece while the library becomes the
reference work. (`parse_guardrails_toml` below still parses the pre-restructure
single-file shape directly, for callers -- today, only its own tests -- that
have a whole library as one TOML document rather than one `guardrails/<key>.toml`
file per entry; `discovery.py`'s real assembly path is `parse_guardrail_entry`.)

A guardrail is data that produces an ordinary tool policy -- applying one
writes `read/write/send/approval_eur/approval_actions/only` into a department
frame, exactly as `GuardrailPreset` (`plugins/manifest.py`) does today.
`authz/pdp.py` never learns that a guardrail library exists.

Unlike `GuardrailPreset.approval_actions`, this model's `approval_actions` is
NOT restricted to `RIGHTS` -- Task 1 (`authz/pdp.py::authorize_tool`) taught
the PDP to match `approval_actions` against a tool key as well as a right, so
an entry naming a plugin-defined tool (e.g. "post_message") is legitimate
here. This parser has no access to the plugin's real tool list, so it stays
permissive on the string itself; it only rejects the empty string, which can
never name anything.
