"""Making a repeated side-effectful tool call safe (§8.7 R5).

A prerequisite for a self-driving agent runtime rather than a refinement. Without
checkpoints, a killed container restarts its task from the beginning; for an agent
that writes to an external system, "from the beginning" means doing the write
again. Three identical Odoo quotes came out of exactly that kind of repetition.

Two deliberate limits:

- **Reads are not recorded.** Deduplicating a search would hide changes the agent
  is supposed to see -- the whole point of reading twice is that the answer may
  differ. This holds only as far as the CONNECTION says which of its tools are
  reads: `required_right` fail-closes an unlisted tool to `write`, so a
  connection with no declared scopes has every read cached and replayed here,
  which is the opposite of this rule. That is not hypothetical -- see
  `warn_unclassified_connection`, which exists because it happened.
- **A replay is announced, not disguised.** The stored result comes back with a
  note saying no second action was taken. Returning it silently would let the
  agent report having created a second quote that does not exist, which is a
  worse failure than the duplicate it prevents.

The trade-off this accepts: two *intentionally* identical writes inside one task
collapse into one. That is rare and usually a bug, and the announcement makes it
visible rather than silent.

    Seen live 2026-07-30: a connection created before its plugin declared its

    already exist -- and its reads were still being cached three days later.
    Nothing anywhere said so, which is the only reason it lasted that long.

    the plugin so the connection gets its declared scopes) belongs to an
