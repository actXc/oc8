"""Turn a human's decision into work the agent performs.

The agent that raised the decision did not wait for it -- see
`control_tools.REQUEST_DECISION` -- so nothing is sitting there to hand it to.
Without this the inbox would be a dead end: the operator clicks, the row says
"approved", and the customer waits forever.

The decision therefore becomes a fresh run through the ordinary intake path, the
same one a cron trigger or an operator uses. That has a consequence worth
stating: the new run starts a NEW conversation and remembers nothing, so the
instruction has to carry its own context. Hence the original question and basis
travel with it, not just "approved".
