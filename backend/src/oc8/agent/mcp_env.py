"""The environment an MCP bridge subprocess is launched with.

FOUR places launch a bridge: the in-process engine loop (agent/engine.py), the
MCP gateway a packaged runtime talks to (api/mcp_gateway.py), the internal-agent
step endpoint (api/v1/internal_agent.py), and the "test connection" button
(api/v1/mcp.py). Each used to carry its own copy of the same three-line loop
over `secret_env`, which is precisely how one path gains a capability the other
three silently miss. One function now, called by all four.

`secret_env` maps an environment-variable NAME to a ref, resolved only
immediately before the launch -- never when the connection is created, and never
on the way out to a browser. Two kinds of ref exist:

* a plain secret-store name, resolved verbatim (odoo_mcp's Odoo password);
* ``oauth:<label>``, meaning "mint a FRESH provider access token from the OAuth
  connection this MCP connection was set up against". Only the prefix is read;
  the label after it is for a human reading the manifest. A Microsoft Graph
  access token lives about an hour, so a stored copy would be expired on nearly
  every launch -- the token has to be minted per launch, from the long-lived
  credential the OAuthConnection holds. `config["oauth_connection_id"]` names
  that connection and is written by the plugin setup form (api/v1/capas.py)
  from the manifest's `[plugin.setup.oauth_provision]` block;
* ``oauth-delegated:<mailbox>``, Google Workspace's domain-wide-delegation
  counterpart to ``oauth:`` -- the mailbox to impersonate travels inside the
  ref itself rather than through a separate lookup table. Resolved by minting
  a token for that mailbox from the same `oauth_connection_id`, scoped with
  `config["delegated_scope"]` (a plain, non-secret string a plugin's setup
  writes from its manifest -- never hardcoded here).

    delegated identity, including on a call that touches none of them. Letting
    a single failed mint propagate meant the day one mailbox in the list was
    offboarded, deleted or misspelled, the bridge stopped launching and the
    whole pack went dark -- including every tool that never touches a mailbox
    at all. So a failed delegated mint leaves that one env var EMPTY and is
    logged; the bridge's own per-identity lookup (google_api.py's
    `resolve_mailbox_token`) then raises a precise "no token available for
    mailbox X" at the one tool call that actually needed X, and nothing else
    is affected.

    has no working tools to degrade to and should fail loudly here instead.
