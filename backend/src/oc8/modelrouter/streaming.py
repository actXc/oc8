"""Streaming completions through the router.

The router was request/response only. A real agent harness streams, so the LLM
gateway (§8.7 R1) needs this path -- and it needs it without losing the two things
the control plane exists to do: report usage and stay provider-neutral.

Two rules encoded here:

- **Usage must be asked for.** An OpenAI-compatible upstream reports usage on a
  stream only when the request carries ``stream_options: {include_usage: true}``.
  Omitting it means every streamed call bills zero, which makes the §15.4 budget
  blind precisely for the traffic a self-driving runtime generates.
- **No provider may silently break.** An adapter without a ``stream`` method
  degrades to a single chunk holding the whole answer, rather than failing or
  being skipped.
