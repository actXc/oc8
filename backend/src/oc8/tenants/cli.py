Community is single-tenant in production, provisioned by `POST /auth/setup`

administrator-invitation CLI here. What remains is everything else an
operator needs against an existing tenant: listing it, and managing its

    That is the whole design of this command and it is not an optimisation in

    for every statement after it, so a single transaction spanning five hundred
    rows with a commit at the end would be fine -- and a single transaction with
    a commit per row would silently apply only the first. Both shapes are one
    keystroke apart and only one of them fails loudly.

    So each row opens its own session, binds the tenant, writes, and commits. The
    cost is five hundred short transactions; what it buys is that row 500 naming
    a role that does not exist does not throw away the 499 that were correct, and
    that the report at the end is true row by row.
