"""The people a tenant knows, and where each of them stands (§1).

Until now a human was five claims in a JWT and nothing else. There was no row
for a person anywhere in the schema, so the sentence "his department, and not
the whole company's" had no term it could be true in: `GET /approvals` filtered
on status alone and handed back every pending approval in the tenant.

Two tables, and the split matters. `org_member` is WHO -- one row per human the
tenant has seen, minted from the token's `sub`. `org_member_department` is a
SEAT: this person, this department, this seat role. A person's authority is the
union of their seats, read live from these rows on every request.

**Nothing here is in the token.** No new claim, no change to `auth/principal.py`.
A seat granted or revoked takes effect on the caller's next request rather than
on their next token refresh -- non-negotiable for authority that releases money,
and the reason `POST /members/.../departments/...` does not need to talk to
an external identity provider at all.

**Revoked, not deleted.** "Who could approve this, and until when" is the first
question an audit asks; a DELETE answers it with silence. Same reason
`ApprovalChannelBinding.revoked_at` exists.

**No `org_role` mirror column.** A denormalised copy of the token's role would be
two sources of truth for one fact, written on every request and consulted by one
caller -- stale in exactly the direction that costs money.
