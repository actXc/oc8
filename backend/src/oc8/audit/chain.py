"""Per-tenant append-only hash chain.

Each event stores ``hash = sha256(prev_hash || canonical(event))`` where
``prev_hash`` is the previous event's hash for the same tenant (genesis = 32
zero bytes). Tampering with any event breaks verification from that link on.

Rows carry a ``mac_version``: 0 is that plain sha256, 1 is HMAC-SHA256 under a
key derived from the root KEK (§12.5), selected by ``audit_mac_enabled``.
Hashing dispatches on each row's OWN version so mixed-version chains verify
across the switch point, and ``append_event`` refuses to write a version below
the tenant's current head -- an unkeyed row needs no secret to forge.
