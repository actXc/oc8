"""The outward-once cap must land on the EVENT, not on the tool name.

Three calendar tools joined `outward_tools` because an event with attendees
lands on those attendees' calendars, including at other companies. With nothing
for `outward_target` to key on, that classification degrades to "once per task,
period" -- and `events.insert` creates exactly one event per request and has no
batch form, so an agent asked to book three interview slots gets a refusal on
call 2 with nothing it can do differently. This asserts the manifest's
`focus_spec` really does scope the cap, using the REAL manifest and the REAL
core function rather than a hand-written spec that could drift from either.
