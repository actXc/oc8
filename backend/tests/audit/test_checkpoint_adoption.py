"""Turning OC8_AUDIT_MAC_ENABLED on over an existing chain (§12.5).

Migration 0031 adopts unsigned checkpoints only if the flag happens to be on
WHEN THE MIGRATION RUNS. The normal rollout is the other order -- migrations
ship, the flag is turned on later -- and in that ordering every checkpoint that
has verified something and carries no marker hits the erasure branch on the
first keyed tick and is reported as mac_downgrade, which is deliberately
unclearable in band. `oc8 audit-adopt-checkpoints` is the in-band remedy.
