    """A plugin token can no longer start a run at all.

    This test used to assert the opposite: /run had no role gate, so a plugin
    token reached it, and the guarantee under test was that its subject must NOT
    be recorded as `originating_operator` -- otherwise resolve_responsible
    mislabels it ("operator", subject) in the tamper-evident audit trail.

    That guarantee still holds and still matters as defence in depth
    (`test_resolve_responsible_fallback_chain` covers it directly). What changed
    is that the situation is no longer reachable over HTTP: /run now requires
    `run:start`, a plugin principal carries scopes rather than an operator role,
    and an unknown role holds nothing. The hole that made the old assertion
    necessary is closed rather than merely compensated for -- so this asserts the
    closure, which is the stronger statement."""
