"""A decision that lands while the run is still parking must not be lost.

The gateway writes its park marker, the adapter notices, the container is torn
down, and only then does the executor transition the run to WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL.
An operator deciding inside that window recorded the decision against a run that
was still RUNNING -- so nothing re-queued it, and the run waited forever for a
decision that had already been made.

`resolved_tool_approvals` accumulates across every approval cycle a run goes
through, so a run parking a SECOND time (for a different call) already carries
the first call's decided entry. Matching on mere presence of that list would
re-queue the run before anyone decided the new call -- see
test_a_second_park_with_only_a_stale_decision_stays_parked below.

The race has two halves, closed on two different sides:

  * `requeue_if_already_decided` (executor.py), tested above, catches a decision
    that was ALREADY COMMITTED by the time the run's WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL
    transition runs.
  * `resolve_tool_approval`'s re-read (approval_resume.py), tested below, catches
    a decision whose own write blocks on that very transition's row lock and
    lands the instant it releases -- narrower (milliseconds, not the seconds of
    a poll-plus-teardown), but the same stranding if left open.

    lock (its outer `tenant_session` has not committed yet) when an operator's
