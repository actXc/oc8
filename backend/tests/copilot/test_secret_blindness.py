"""Secret-blindness for the tenant Assistant's chat gate.

Retired 2026-08-31 together with the raw-completion Copilot chat path
(`oc8.copilot.chat`, deleted in Task 5 of the unified-assistant plan) --
`oc8.chat.service.send_message` now carries the same pre-model secret gate
that `respond_to_copilot_message` used to run, reusing the same
`oc8.copilot.redaction.is_secret_request`/`redact_text` helpers. Scoped to
the tenant Assistant only; the other two tests below pin the scoping from
both directions -- an ordinary agent's chat is unaffected by the gate, and
a benign message to the Assistant itself is NOT refused.
