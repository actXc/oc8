"""Agent containers left behind by a worker that died mid-run.

Teardown lives in a `finally`, which covers a failing run but not a killed
process: a `docker compose up -d --build worker` during a run skips it entirely.
Observed live, 2026-07-27: two agent containers still running 40+ minutes after
their runs had finished -- each holding a live run-scoped token, each able to
keep writing to the customer's system.

The dangerous half of this is not leaving one behind, it is killing the wrong
one, so the rule is narrow: remove a container only when the run named IN ITS
OWN NAME is finished. A sibling worker's live run is not finished, so its
containers are never touched.
