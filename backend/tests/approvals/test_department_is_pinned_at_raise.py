"""Where an approval belongs is decided once, when it is raised.

`approval_request.department_id` is denormalised rather than joined through the
agent, and both source designs converged on the same two reasons:

* moving an agent between departments must not drag its pending approvals with
  it -- somebody is looking at that queue right now;
* a join is a second place the messenger fan-out would forget the term.

`Task.department_id` is deliberately never consulted. The agent is authoritative:
`ApprovalRequest.agent_id` is NOT NULL and `Agent.department_id` is NOT NULL, so
the derivation always succeeds, whereas `task_id` is nullable and a held tool
call raised outside a task would land nowhere.
