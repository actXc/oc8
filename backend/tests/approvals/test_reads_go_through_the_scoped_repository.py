"""The read term's forcing function.

Modelled on `tests/api/test_every_route_is_governed.py`, and for the same reason
that file exists: the permission layer was not missing because anyone decided
those routes should be open, it was missing because nothing ever forced a new
route to say. Here the thing nothing forces is narrower and worse -- a new
screen, a new export, a new digest e-mail writes `select(m.ApprovalRequest)`,
gets every department in the tenant, and looks exactly like the code beside it.

Both source designs left this to convention. Convention is what
`api/v1/feed.py:66` is: a list filtered on status alone that has handed back the
whole company's approvals since the day it was written.

So a human-facing load of an `ApprovalRequest` or a `Clarification` is legal in
one of a few named modules and nowhere else. The allowlist is short on purpose --
each entry is a claim that the module either resolves a department itself or has
no human in it at all, and adding one is that claim being made out loud.
