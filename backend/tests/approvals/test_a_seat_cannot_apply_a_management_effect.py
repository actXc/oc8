"""`approval:decide` is not one right. It is polymorphic on `action_type`.

Reproduced end to end before `EFFECT_PERMISSIONS` existed, with a token whose
role is `member` (`frozenset()`) holding one `dept_approver` seat:

    GET  /budgets                              -> 403
    POST /approvals/{budget_incident}/decision -> 200
    budget.override_until                      -> 2026-09-01   <-- a month's spend
    POST /approvals/{hire_agent}/decision      -> 200
    agent.deleted_at                           -> set          <-- an agent, deleted

`resolve_budget_incident` sets `override_until` and un-pauses the frozen scope --
the same act as `PUT /budgets`, which is `budget:manage`. `resolve_hire_agent`
activates a pending agent or soft-deletes it -- `agent:manage`. Neither is in
`SEAT_PERMISSIONS`, and `tests/authz/test_seat_vocabulary.py` did not see it,
because it asserts the STRINGS are absent from the seat dict and they are: the
effect is reached through the row, not through the vocabulary.

This slice is also what routed the first one into a seat-holder's queue.
`metering/budget.py` now files the incident under the breaching department; it
carried no department at all before, and the route was
`require_permission(APPROVAL_DECIDE)`, which a `member` token failed outright.
