"""The realtime socket must not be a way round `GET /activity`'s permission.

Reproduced before this gate existed, against the running app: an employee token
-- role `member`, which holds `frozenset()`, holding no seat at all -- was
accepted onto `/events/ws` and received

    {'type': 'activity.logged', 'data': {
        'agent_id': 'engineering-agent',
        'message': 'Ada oeffnet Produktionszugang fuer Kunde Gartenholz',
        'detail': 'prod.deploy(env=live, secret_ref=...)'}}

while `GET /activity` answered him 403. Same rows, same tenant, one door open.

The producers are not incidental. `agent/control_tools.py` writes
`"Entscheidung angefragt: {question}"` with `context[:500]` as detail -- the very
question `GET /clarifications` scopes by department -- and `realtime/emit.py`'s
`note_focus` writes what an agent is working on right now.

This is not per-department rooms; those are §10 item 5 and slice 2. It is the
narrower claim §9 already makes for this slice and which did not hold: the
socket's audience is exactly the HTTP route's.
