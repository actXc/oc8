"""What the two queue endpoints actually put on the wire.

The first test here is the important one and it is a confidentiality test, not a
cosmetic one. `ApprovalRequest.payload` is a free-form JSONB blob that every
raiser writes into and that `approvals/service.py::_announce` writes
`channel_handles` into -- which messenger accounts were told about this approval,
i.e. whose private chat id. §5 says the DTO takes two named keys out of it and
never serializes it wholesale, and "never" is only true if something checks.

The rest pin the additive fields the workspace screen is built on. Each one was
absent before this slice, so a serializer that silently dropped them would leave
the detail pane -- the whole reason the screen exists -- showing an id and a
title.
