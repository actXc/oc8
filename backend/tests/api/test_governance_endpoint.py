"""The permission model, made readable to the people it refuses.

The layer decides correctly and explains nothing: `403 requires permission:
plugin:manage` does not say which role holds it, nor whether the caller's own
role is one the deployment recognises. The unrecognised case is the expensive
one -- every screen comes back empty, which reads as a broken product rather
than as an IdP group nobody mapped.

Once roles can be tenant-defined this endpoint has to answer three more things
without becoming the one place a seatless caller can read the tenant's authority
map:

* **the caller's OWN resolved authority and its SOURCE** -- "aus Ihrer Rolle
  `operator`" versus "aus der Rolle *Freigabe Vertrieb*, die Ihnen zugewiesen
  wurde". `callerPermissions` was `permissions_for(principal.role)`, which for
  exactly the population this slice creates renders "holds 0 of 52";
* **nothing at all about anybody else's** -- the tenant's role catalogue lives at
  `GET /roles`, behind `role:view`. This route is `unguarded()` because 12c40e6
  recorded the bug of gating it, and that reason string is only true while it
  enumerates nothing;
* **human and agent roles as two lists**, because today `agent_default` is the
  leftmost column of the governance screen with `tool:send` as a row beside
  `plugin:manage`.

And it must survive the database being unavailable, because the screen that
explains a refusal must never be the first thing to die.
