"""The one state that is a genuine misconfiguration, and the screen that has to
say so.

Three ways a person can hold nothing company-wide, and they need three different
sentences because they send the reader to three different places:

* their token role is `member` -- **correct**, by design, their authority is
  their seats;
* their token role is not one this deployment defines -- **the identity
  provider**, someone must map the group;
* a role WAS assigned to them and that row cannot grant -- **`org_member.role_id`**,
  one nullable column, and nothing about their token is wrong at all.

The third was rendered as the first. `Authority.role` is deliberately left NULL
for an unusable assignment -- a name printed beside an empty set reads as "the
role is empty" rather than "the role is unusable" -- so `callerTenantRoleName`
was null, so the screen fell through to *"your token carries `org_admin`, which
holds nothing company-wide BY DESIGN"*: false in both halves, on the one page in
the product whose entire job is to be believed about a refusal. The frontend even
carried a branch written for this case; with no field to key it off, that branch
could never fire.

Both routes into the state are exercised, because the resolver refuses them on
two different lines and a fix that only covered one would still be wrong half the
time. Both are written directly, which is how they occur: `POST /roles` refuses an
agent-kind assignment and `DELETE` refuses a role somebody holds, so an unusable
assignment arrives by restore, by psql, or from an importer written next year --
which is exactly the arrival the resolver's own docstring is about.
