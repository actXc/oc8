"""Two people, and five hundred. The same feature has to be right at both ends.

The ask this slice answers is one sentence with a contradiction in it: *"the IT
admin must create and assign roles himself, as simple as possible -- and it has
to fit a two-user tenant without being overkill AND a 500+ user tenant and be
configurable."*

Those are two different tests, not one:

**Two people.** The correct amount of this feature for them is NONE. Not a
default role, not a starter set, not a migration that backfills something
sensible: `create_tenant` writes the same five `role` rows it always wrote, zero
`role_permission` rows and zero assignments, and both people resolve to the code
table byte for byte. Every earlier draft of this feature failed here rather than
at the top end -- a layer that seeds "sensible defaults" is a layer that changes
what a live tenant may do on the day it is installed, and the doctrine at
`permissions.py:18-24` exists because an authorization layer whose grants come
from rows locks every operator out the day the rows are missing.

**Five hundred people.** The correct amount is O(1) per POLICY, never per person.
*"Jede Teamleitung darf ab jetzt auch das Prüfprotokoll lesen"* is one `PUT
/roles/{id}` that lands for forty people on their next request -- not forty
writes, not a nightly sync, not a token refresh. That single property is the
entire reason this design has roles rather than per-person grants, and it is why
§5.4's snapshot cache is deliberately not built: a cache makes "on their next
request" false, and the window is exactly as long as the revocation is wrong for.
