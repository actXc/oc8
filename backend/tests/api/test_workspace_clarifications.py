"""The other half of the queue: the question an agent parked mid-run.

There is no endpoint for these at all today. A run that stopped to ask something
sits in `waiting_for_input` and the only way to answer it is
`POST /runs/{run_id}/answer`, which is gated on `run:control` -- a permission in
no seat vocabulary, held only by tenant-wide roles. So the employee whose answer
the agent is waiting for is precisely the person who cannot give it.

That admin door is deliberately left exactly as it is (§4). These tests are about
the new one, which is scoped by the agent's department -- `Clarification.agent_id`
is NOT NULL (`models/run.py:71`), so the department is one join away and the row
needs no column of its own.
