"""`/governance` is the page the workspace's "you hold no seat" empty state links
to, labelled "What may I do?". It told the entire population this slice creates
that their role does not exist.

`member` was deliberately absent from `BUILTIN_ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, so
`callerRoleIsKnown` was False for every employee and `src/routes/governance.tsx`
rendered, under an amber warning triangle:

    "This deployment does not define a role called 'member', so it grants
     nothing at all. That is why other screens appear empty. Map your identity
     provider's group to one of the roles below."

The remedy it prescribes -- map the group to `operator`, `dept_manager` or
`auditor` -- is the tenant-wide grant this slice exists to avoid. Meanwhile
`app-shell.tsx` labels the same role "Employee / Mitarbeiter" in the header chip.

The half that was supposed to say the true thing was on the wire and rendered
nowhere: `GovernanceDTO` gained `seats` and `seatRoles` for precisely this
sentence (§5: "so the screen that explains a refusal can say 'you hold no
seat'") and `grep seats src/routes/governance.tsx` returned nothing.
