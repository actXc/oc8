"""What a tenant's own administrator may put in a role -- and what it costs to
add a permission after today.

The one assertion this file exists for is
`test_every_permission_is_classified_exactly_once`. Every earlier attempt at
this feature computed the offerable set as `ALL_PERMISSIONS - UNGRANTABLE`, and
every one of them failed OPEN in the same way: the seat slice added
`member:manage`, `approval:view_any` and `approval:decide_any` to the catalogue
without touching the role builder, and under a deny-list all three would have
appeared as tickable boxes. `member:manage` is the right to enrol yourself in
any department; the two `_any` flags ARE the words "in every department". Any
one of them, ticked once, ends the department boundary the previous slice was
written to create.

So the partition is three hand-written sets and the union check is the forcing
function: a permission added to `ALL_PERMISSIONS` fails the build until a human
has said which of the three it belongs to. Nothing here is about today's 52
strings; it is about the 53rd.
