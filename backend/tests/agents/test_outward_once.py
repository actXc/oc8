"""A person is reached once per task, whatever the model does.

Live, 2026-07-28: one helpdesk ticket, one customer question, two complete
answers written into the chatter inside a single run. Both calls were
individually legitimate -- different bodies, so idempotency saw two different
calls -- and the policy engine only ever asked "may this agent send?", which is
yes both times. The customer got two answers to one question.

The mission was told "exactly one customer-visible message per run" and the
model ignored it. That is the whole reason this lives in the core: a rule the
model may decline to follow is not a guardrail.
