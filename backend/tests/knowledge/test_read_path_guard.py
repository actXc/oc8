"""Forgetting the deleted_at predicate must fail the build, not the review.

`retrieval.py` is the only place that reads `kb_chunk` today, and both
production readers funnel through `retrieve_kb_context` -- but that is a fact
about the code as it stands, not a guarantee about the next read path somebody
adds. A read that forgets the predicate is indistinguishable from never having
deleted anything, and it fails silently: the deletion still LOOKS done
everywhere an operator would check.

So the rule is structural, in the idiom of
`tests/api/test_every_route_is_governed.py`: the model is referenced only inside
a named set of modules, and every read starts at `live_chunks()`.

The check is an IMPORT guard rather than a call-shape guard on purpose. Matching
`select(KbChunk)` would miss `db.get`, `select(KbChunk.content, ...)`, and the
raw SQL that hybrid retrieval will most naturally use.
