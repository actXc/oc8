"""One lock order, and what it costs when a lock is lost anyway.

Every path in this slice that removes knowledge touches the same three lock
objects -- the `data_source` row, the `knowledge_base` row and the tenant's audit
advisory lock -- and it was measured taking them in three different orders:

    SYNC                : ['data_source', 'knowledge_base', 'data_source']
    OPERATOR DOC DELETE : ['knowledge_base', 'data_source', 'ADVISORY', ...]
    HELD SYNC           : ['ADVISORY', 'data_source', ...]

Two AB/BA cycles, both reproduced against real rows with "deadlock detected",
and the first of them reachable on a default deployment: deleting ONE document
while a source syncs into that base needs no flag at all.

So this file does two things. It traces the real statements the real functions
emit and fails the build if any path inverts the order written down in
`tombstone.py`'s module docstring -- because an order that only holds by luck is
an order that the next edit silently breaks. And it pins the consequence: a
transaction lost to a deadlock in the post-fetch bookkeeping used to take the
whole sync's ingested documents with it, which is a wholly disproportionate
price for failing to update a counter.
