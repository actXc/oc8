"""An accepted handoff lands on the team lead's desk as work.

§14a.3 says an intake "materializes as a new task assigned to the team-lead
agent, who decomposes it per delegation". It did not: `accept_handoff` moved a
status and recorded a task id the CALLER had to supply, so accepting produced a
row and nothing to do. Measured before the fix: 413 tasks, none delegated, and
no run had ever had a delegation source.

This is also the answer to what a lead is for. Two agents already share one
queue — the record claim keeps them apart, and a coordinator handing out
tickets would cost two runs each and buy nothing. A lead earns its place where
work arrives as ONE lump somebody has to cut up, which is what a handoff is.
